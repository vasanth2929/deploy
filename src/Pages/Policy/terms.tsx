            <strong>Model &amp; Property Releases</strong>: Any content uploaded
            to the platform that features identifiable people or private
            property must have an accompanying release from those identifiable
            people or the property owner under which they give their consent for
            public usage of their images. This is meant by the term &quot;Model
            Release&quot; or &quot;Property Release&quot;. Commercial use of
            images requires these releases, while editorial use generally does
            not. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the content
            is suitable for their use and does not infringe any rights.
            Stocklerz is not responsible for verifying the existence of a valid
            model or property release and it is solely the responsibility of the
            content uploader/contributor to obtain and provide such releases if
            necessary.
